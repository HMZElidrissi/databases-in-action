# Introduction

Welcome to my personal documentation repository for learning and navigating the world of databases.

## Structure & Navigation

On this site you will find a comprehensive collection of notes, insights, and tutorials that I've gathered while diving into the world of databases. 

The documentation is organized into several sections, each of which is dedicated to a specific topic or aspect of databases. You can navigate through the documentation using the sidebar on the left.

## What is it for?

The main purpose of this documentation is to serve as a reference for myself, and to help me remember the things I've learned. However, I've decided to make it public in case it might be useful to someone else.
